/**********************************************************************
 * Aggregates events to call their handler at a reduced frequency.
 *
 * handler: The event handler to call, may receive a parameter depending
 *          on dataPolicy.
 * timeout: First timeout (ms) from event reception to handler call.
 *          Default value: 1000.
 * dataPolicy: What to call the handler with. Default: DP_NONE.
 * latency: How long to wait (ms) after calling the handler before
 *          the next call. Default: timeout.
 * maxDelays: How many times to delay calling the handler while in
 *          "burst mode". Default: 0 (do not delay).
 * delayTimeout: How long to delay (ms) calling the handler if more
 *          events are received in a waiting period. Default: timeout/2.
 *
 * The events are reported to the aggregator with the update method.
 * The handler is called with different data depending on dataPolicy:
 * - DP_NONE : nothing.
 * - DP_FIRST: first event received since last call.
 * - DP_LAST : last event received since last call.
 * - DP_COUNT: number of events received since last call.
 * - DP_ALL  : an array with all the events received since last call.
