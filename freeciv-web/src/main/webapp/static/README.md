Static
------

This folder is intended to contain all javascript, css and images for the frontpage and multiplayer listings.

The content was split for the following reasons:

1. Allows a new developer understand which content is used on which part of the project.
2. Allows a developer to change a library without affecting the Freeciv-web client.
3. Allows for an easier configuration of the minifiers.

So to summarize, resources for the Freeciv-web client go in the root directory, and resources for the site go in this directory.
