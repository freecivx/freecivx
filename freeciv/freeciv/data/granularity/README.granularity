 General
 -------

 Ruleset with high granularity values. This makes it possible to have
more fine grained ruleset effects without integer math pecularities
messing with them.

 You can consider all the outputs and costs to be 100x as valuable
as in more standard rulesets.
 Each movement point is divided to 6 fragments, so granularity of
movement costs is 1/6 points.


 Rules
 -----

 * City center tiles get +25 trade until city size 8, +100 after
 * For cities to work oceanic tiles, Fishing must be known
 * Cities are protected a bit from rapid shrinking due to
   continuous famine by the fact that when city shrinks,
   its granary is set to 10% full, not empty
