legend = _("Columbus landed on Jamaica in 1494. The island was colonized by\
 the Spanish but in 1655 it was conquered by the English, who turned the\
 island into a slave-based plantation economy. Slavery was abolished in\
 1834. The country became an independent country within the Commonwealth\
 in 1962. Jamaica is famous around the world for its music; genres such\
 as reggae and ska originated on the island.")
