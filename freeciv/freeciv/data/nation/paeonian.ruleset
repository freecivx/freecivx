legend = _("The Paeonians were an ancient people that inhabited the areas\
 north of Macedon, between the Thracian and Illyrian tribes. Their\
 language probably had a mixed Thraco-Illyrian origin. The seat of the\
 Paeonian kings was Bylazora. In 360-359 BCE, southern Paeonian tribes\
 launched raids into Macedon, but the Macedons defeated and\
 conquered them. A Paeonian military contingent participated in the\
 expedition of Alexander the Great to Persia.")
