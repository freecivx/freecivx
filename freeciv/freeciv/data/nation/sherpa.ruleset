legend = _("Sherpas are an ethnic group who settled in the Himalaya region\
 of modern-day Nepal in the 15th century. They are of Tibetan stock and\
 speak a language related to modern Tibetan though they are not mutually\
 intelligible. After a few centuries of autonomy, Sherpa communities\
 came by the 18th century under military pressure from encroaching\
 Hindu polities, such as the Bengal based Sen Empire. By the 18th century\
 the Sherpa homeland had been annexed into the Kingdom of Nepal. Following\
 the democratization of Nepal in the beginning of the 21st century,\
 there have been calls for greater autonomy for the Sherpas within the\
 federal republic.")
