legend = _("The southern third of modern Benin was once a historic kingdom\
 known variously as Agbome (c. 1600 - c. 1700), Danhome (c. 1700 - 1730), and\
 Dahomey (1730 - 1894). In 1730 the country became a tributary of the\
 neighboring kingdom of Oyo. It was conquered by France in the second\
 Franco-Dahomean war (1892 - 1894) and was split into Agbome and Alada.  In\
 the 18th and 19th centuries Dahomey was known for its fierce ahosi (gbeto)\
 warriors: an army of women who were the king's official bodyguards and\
 celibate wives.")
