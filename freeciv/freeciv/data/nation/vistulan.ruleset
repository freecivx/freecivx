 the area of Lesser Poland. Little is known about their history. Many\
 historians agree that throughout the early Middle Ages Vistulans were\
 one of the strongest Slavic tribes of today's Poland, but conflicts\
 with Great Moravia and Magyars prevented them from forming a stable and\
 lasting state. Eventually, the lands of Vistulans and several other\
 Slavic tribes were unified by Polonians, who formed the first Polish\
 state in the 10th century.")
