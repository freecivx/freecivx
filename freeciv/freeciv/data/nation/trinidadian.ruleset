legend = _("Trinidad and Tobago is a country in the Caribbean, consisting\
 of the two eponymous islands. It is the most populous country of the\
 Lesser Antilles. Trinidad was sighted by Columbus in 1498, and remained\
 a Spanish colony until it was conquered by the British during the\
 Napoleonic wars; Tobago was colonized by Curonians, Spanish, Dutch,\
 French and Swedes but eventually also ended up in British hands. The\
 islands have been independent since 1962. The islands' economy is based\
 on oil and is relatively developed when compared to its Caribbean\
 neighbors. Trinidad and Tobago is famous for its music and its Carnival.")
