 Western Iranic people, the Medes, relatives of the European Scythians.\
 Their state preceded the Persian Achaemenid Empire, which was formed\
 as a result of a rebellion of the Persians against the Median ruler\
 Astyages. It was the first multi-ethnic empire and controlled a\
 vast area spanning from the Halys river to what is now Afghanistan.")
